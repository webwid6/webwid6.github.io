First, write down the decimal divided by one, which in this case would be 0.3/1. Multiply the top and bottom parts of the fraction by 10 until both are whole numbers. In the case of 0.3, multiply each part by 10 to get the result 0.3 equals 3… First, we find 1/3 of 1/4 as being 1/12. Therefore, 2/3 has to be double that much, or 2/12. After introducing the shortcut for fraction multiplication (multiply the numerators, multiply the denominators), I solve a few simple problems and a word problem. When multiplying fractions, multiply both their numerators and both their denominators. If we want to write both of the terms as fractions, we would write 2/3xx18/1 Which then becomes =(2xx18)/(3xx1)=36/3 This equals 36-:3=12. 3/8 times 1/2? - coolconversion.com - Multiplying mixed numbers (video) | Khan Academy - 3.13 as a fraction - Get Easy Solution - Multiplying fractions by fractions - free lesson with a video - what is 1/3 times 1/3 in fraction form? | Yahoo Answers - How to multiply 1/2 by 3.
